# La Esquina del CÃ³digo

My personal blog, written in **TypeScript** and using **Next.js** with the
latest features from React: **Server Components**.

The `modules` folder comes from a previous version of the blog where I tried to
implement the Onion Architecture. It helped me to migrate the blog in a breeze.

I'm using `Storyblok` as the current headless CMS, but it might change in the
future because the Onion Architecture allows me to change the CMS provider
(a.k.a the infrastructure) without changing the business logic. Who knows? Maybe
I won't change it at all, but it's nice to have the option.

I tried to optimize it for SEO as much as I could, but I'm not an expert in that
field. I'm open to suggestions.

For now, I'm publishing the blog in Spanish, but I'm planning to translate it to
English in the future.
